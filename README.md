<h1> School Management System </h1>
A fully schoool mangement system made on django framework using python where there are multiypes of people like principal,teacher,student and parent having different responsibility and access to different things acc to their roles. There is a multiuser login system where on login you can state the type of user and show him acc to his/her access roles only.
